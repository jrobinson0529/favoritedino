      I am Jesse, a student at NSS, Sushi-chef, and slayer off all prehistoric lizards. If I come across a dinosaur in my day to day I am ready
      at all times with my damascus steel katana. I am the harbringer of doom to these daemons known as <strong>dinosaurs</strong>. I am the
      second coming of the meteor that <em>almost</em> eradicated them the first time.

      <p>Chaoyangsaurus ("Chaoyang lizard") was a marginocephalian dinosaur from the Late Jurassic of China (dated to between 150.8 and 145.5 million years ago). Chaoyangsaurus belonged to the Ceratopsia (Greek for "horned faces"), Chaoyangsaurus, like all ceratopsians, was primarily a herbivore.</p>
      <p>This is my personal favorite dinosaur because it is the cutest and the easiest to pet. Also they are primarily herbivores so I don't have to worry about this demonic lizard eating my soul.</p>

      <p>Here is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaoyangsaurus">link</a> to the wiki which is pretty void of information on this dinosaur, but whatever here it is...</p>
